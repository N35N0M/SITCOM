# SITCOM
## [ARDUINO] The Sitcom Machine

_Purpose_: To construct a device that plays a randomly selected tune every time someone walks in the door.

_Goals:_
* Learn basic markdown
* Starting off with a simple project to refresh what little has been learned in the past
* Party factor (a reason in itself)
* Testing git workflow
* Try to have fun and add extra functionality on top of the basic idea.
* Learning how to make the single-board computer Raspberry Pi and the popular microcontroller Arduino Uno talk together.
